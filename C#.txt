1. C# language basics
  - Stack: is a block of memory for storing local variables and paremeters
  - Heap: is a block of memory in which objects reside. when a new object is created, it is allocated on the heap and a reference type to 
  that object is returned
  - value types: the content of a value is simply a value. struct, int, long, float, bool,... 
  - reference types:having 2 parts: an object and the reference to that object. class, string,.. 
  - Passed by value: 
    + value types are passed by value by default 
    + reference types: copies the reference, but not the object. 
      
      static void Foo (StringBuilder fooSB)
      {
         fooSB.Append ("test");
         fooSB = null;
      }
      
      static void main() 
      {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); 
        Foo(sb); 
        Console.Write(sb.ToString()); --------------------> test 
      }
      
      fooSB is a reference copy of sb. in other words, sb and fooSB are 2 seperate variables that reference the same StringBuilder object. 
      because of that, setting fooSB to null does not make sb null.
     
     + string is a reference type but is passed by value by default 
  
  - Out modifier: like ref modifier except:
    + not need not be assigned before going in to a function 
    + need to be assigned before it comes out of a function
    
  - null coalescing operator: if the operand is non null give it to me, otherwise, give me the default value 
    string s1 = null; 
    string s2 = s1 ?? "something"; ------> s2 = "something"
    
  - null conditional operator: 
    + if the operand is null, the expression evaluates to null instead of throwing nullPointerException 
    
      Stringuilder sb = null; 
      string s = sb?.ToString() ----> s = null instead of throwing NullPointerException(); 
  - the as operator: perform downcasting without throwing exception when variable is null
    Person p = null;
    Student t = p // t = null not throwing exception
  - abstract functions like virtual functions except that they have no default implmentation
